## Overview

**Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)** captures images across many narrow and contiguous spectral bands. Unlike RGB imaging, which captures only three color channels, HSI provides a rich spectral signature at every pixel, enabling powerful applications in **remote sensing**, **environmental monitoring**, **precision agriculture**, and **medical diagnostics**.

However, conventional HSI systems face a fundamental **trade-off between spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution**:

- **Spatial Scanning (push-broom systems):** captures one line of the scene at a time, requiring motion of the object or sensor.  
- **Spectral Scanning (filter-based systems):** sequentially captures one wavelength at a time, leading to long acquisition times and temporal misalignment.  
- **Snapshot Imaging:** captures all wavelengths in a single exposure using multiplexed optics or coded apertures, but produces **sparse, spectrally mixed measurements**.

The last category, **snapshot hyperspectral imaging**, offers high-speed acquisition but poses a major reconstruction challenge. Each pixel typically measures only one wavelength, making the recovery of the full 3D hyperspectral cube from a 2D snapshot an **ill-posed inverse problem**.

## Method

In our approach, we address this challenge by combining with **implicit neural representations**, using a **sinusoidal activation function (SIREN)** to model the hyperspectral cube as a continuous function of spatial–spectral coordinates. Each snapshot image is treated as a set of **sparse spectral observations**, where only a fraction of pixels correspond to each wavelength due to coded apertures or filter mosaics.   We model the true hyperspectral signal as a **continuous function**:

<p align="center">
  <strong>f<sub>θ</sub>(x, y; λ) → I(x, y; λ)</strong>
</p>

where (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>; <em>λ</em>) are spatial–spectral coordinates, and <strong>f<sub>θ</sub></strong> is a <strong>SIREN network</strong> (sinusoidal MLP). The sinusoidal activation captures high-frequency spatial and spectral structures that ReLU-based networks miss, a limitation called spectral bias.

The model is trained to minimize a <strong>mean squared reconstruction loss</strong> between predicted intensities and the sparse coded measurements. Once optimized, <strong>f<sub>θ</sub></strong> becomes a <strong>fully continuous hyperspectral field</strong>, from which any wavelength or combination can be queried and visualized at arbitrary resolution.

This approach enables reconstruction of a complete hyperspectral cube from a single coded 2D measurement, performing both spectral interpolation and extrapolation without any external supervision or prior information.

## 🎥 Results

We tested our method on **four hyperspectral datasets**: **CS-hsdb**, **HS-SOD**, **Dermatology**, and **Pavia University**.  
Each dataset contains 10 spectral bands, resulting in hyperspectral cubes of dimension *(H, W, 10)*.

For each dataset, we masked **90% of the pixels** per spectral band and used **complementary aperture codes** across wavelengths.  
Our reconstruction network then recovered the full hyperspectral cube from these sparse coded measurements.  
Below are qualitative reconstruction results for one spectral band from each dataset.
